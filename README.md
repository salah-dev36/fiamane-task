# Fiamane-image wiki

Fiamane-image wiki is a web application that acts as a images search engine consuming data from Unsplash API

## Feedback
I followed my usual project procedure, which involves deciding at first sight about the architecture of the components and where I'd write the state, and tweak it later if necessary. then i read the documentation for the Unsplash API to learn how to integrate it into the application. Additionally, I reviewed the Tailwind documentation since it was my first time using it, and I found it to be an incredibly intuitive and smooth tool for UI development and responsive design. The only obstacle I encountered was correctly setting up the screenshots in the ReadMe file.
